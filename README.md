Chafity is a charity media platform meant for networking and connecting people in order to make business as well as donate to charity. Users of this platform will define the amount that needs to be donated to their chosen charity fund when another user wishes to connect with them. Once the contact request is sent, the donation will be deducted from one’s credit card however the donation is only transferred to the charity’s bank account only when the request is accepted and contact has been made and confirmed.

##Getting Started

* Clone the application with ```git clone https://github.com/kenigbolo/Chafity.git```

##Dependencies

Once you have those two, you can then run your command line and navigate into the project's folder and then run:

* Run ```bundle install``` to install all other dependencies
* Run ```rake db:migrate```
* Run ```rake db:seed ```

## Running The Server

Due to the use of the ```figaro gem``` for environment variables used in omniauth the following should be performed when running locally

* Download the application.yml file [here]()
* Put the downloaded ```application.yml``` file into the ```config``` folder

You can then run ```rails s``` and visit the page on the browser by typing ```localhost:3000```

##Running The Specs
After all the setting up as mentioned above, you can run the tests. The tests are driven by rspec, capybara and selenium. You can get them fired up by running the following command from the terminal.
