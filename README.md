# CHAFITY
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kenigbolo/Chafity.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kenigbolo/Chafity)

Chafity is a charity media platform meant for networking and connecting people in order to make business as well as donate to charity. Users of this platform will define the amount that needs to be donated to their chosen charity fund when another user wishes to connect with them. Once the contact request is sent, the donation will be deducted from one’s credit card however the donation is only transferred to the charity’s bank account only when the request is accepted and contact has been made and confirmed.

##Getting Started

+ Clone the application with `git clone https://github.com/kenigbolo/Chafity.git` or use ssh  `git clone git@github.com:kenigbolo/Chafity.git`.

##Dependencies

* Ruby version 2.2.1 and above
* Rails 5.0.0
* Imagemagick (Linux distributions) or RMagic (OSX)
* PostgreSQL

### Downloading PostgreSQL
Run these commands from terminal:

`sudo apt-get -y update`

`sudo apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

Once you have postgresql installed, create a superuser for postgresql
`adduser <username>`
`passwd <password>`
after which you can type in
`su - postgres`

Once you have all the dependencies, you can then run your command line and navigate into the project's folder and then run:

* Run `bundle install` to install all other dependencies

Alternatively you can run our automated script by doing the following

* Give the script execution permissions by running `chmod +x install.sh`
* Run `./install.sh` to install all other dependencies

    ***Note*** some gems might cause issues while installing, so for unix/linux users try `sudo gem install <gem_name>`
* Run `rails db:setup` to set up the db, run the migrattions and seed the db all at once. or,
* Run `rails db:migrate` or `rake db:migrate` and then,
* Run `rails db:seed`  or `rake db:seed`.

(*the `rake` command was used for rails version prior rails 5. But it is no logner required*)

## Running The Server

Due to the use of the `figaro gem` for environment variables used in omniauth the following should be performed when running locally

* To download the application.yml file kindly contact the administrator
* Put the downloaded `application.yml` file into the `config` folder

You can then run `rails s` or `rails server` and visit the page on the browser by typing `localhost:3000`. (*you can add the flag `-p <port_number>` to specify a different port number, e.i. `rails s -p 8000`*)

##Running The Specs
After all the setting up as mentioned above, you can run the tests. The tests are driven by rspec, capybara and selenium. You can get them fired up by running the following command from the terminal.

  `rspec spec`

or

  `bundle exec rspec`

##Application Main Features

* Authentication (Log in using Linkedin OAuth)

* Interacting with Influencers
